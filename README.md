## Usage
1. Ensure that the output folder and Creative Cloud folder are correct. The default output folder is `Documents\Adobe\Fonts` and the default Creative Cloud folder is  `%appdata%\Adobe`.
2. Click "Retrieve" to populate the left-most box with a list of all font files found. Select the ones you'd like to export (all of them by default), and then select "Copy".

## Settings
+ Verbose logging - shows individual messages for each file. Useful if you think a file is being skipped over or just want to see things happening in realtime.
+ Open folder when finished - opens the output folder once all files are copied over.

## Issues
If you have issues, open an issue in the issues tab.
